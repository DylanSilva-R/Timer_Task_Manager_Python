# Timer+TaskManager

- Motivation? I made this program because I wanted to create a minimallistic timer and task manager to keep track of my work flow.
- Why? Ubuntu doesn't have a stopwatch+task manager so I decided to create my own.
- What problem does it solve? It accurately keeps track of the users tasks and keeps track of time.
